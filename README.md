## 💪 Challenges I faced

- Show flash messages when updating & deleting the tasks.
- Mailing in the development & production environments.

- How to use the `turbo-frame` & `turbo-stream` to update UI for the tasks and show flash messages w/o reloading full page.
- Create SQLite database in production.
- How to create themes in the TailwindCSS.
- Use devise to authenticate, confirm, recover and register users.
